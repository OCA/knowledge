<br>
You like Odoo, but feel like you want to personalise it more? You can customize your
dashboard by adding new boards of any<br>
search view.<br>
<br>
<h3>How is it done?</h3><br>
<br>
Step 1: access one search view <br>
<br>
Step 2: apply the filter you want to see at each connection to the application<br>
(eg. on sales, manufacturing, etc)<br>
<br>
Step 3: add it into the dashboard in the same space where you can save the filter<br>
<br>
Step 4: choose the application you want it visible on and the name of the array<br>
<br>
Look at this simple example below from Purchase, where I want to put on the<br>
application's dashboard "Purchases to Approve". After I access the search view<br>
and apply the filter for "Purchases to Approve", I can add it immediately to my<br>
Purchase dashboard.<br>
<br>
<img src="/document_page/static/src/img/add_to_dashboard.png" alt="Add to dashboard" width="500"><br>
<br>
In less than a minute, the search view is visible on the dashboard<br>
<br>
<img src="/document_page/static/src/img/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" width="500"><br>
<br>
Of course, you are free to delete what you don't need or like, but just in case<br>
you change your mind there is a reset button to return to the default view.<br>

The Odoo touchscreen point of sale available with 13.0 allows you<br>
to manage your shop sales very easily.  It's fully web based so that you don't<br>
have to install or deploy any software and all the sales shops can be easily<br>
consolidated.  It works in connected and disconnected modes so that you can<br>
continue to sell if you lose your internet connection.<br>
<br>
<img src="/document_page/static/src/img/POS.png" alt="Point of Sale" width="500"><br>
<br>
<h3>Here's a summary of its main features and benefits:</h3><br>
<br>
100% WEB based<br>
<br>
<ul><li>available for any touchscreen device (ipod, ipad, any tablet)mobile (with portable devices)</li><li>no installation required</li><li>no synchronization needed, completely integrated</li><li>continue working even when your connection is down if you close your browser, data won't be lost</li><li>fully web based with a clean interface smart interface</li></ul><br>
<br>
You have different options to select your products. You can do it through the<br>
barcode reader, just browse through the categories you have put in place (ie.<br>
drinks, snacks, meals, etc.), or text search in case neither of the other<br>
options work for you.  If you need to use the POS for your restaurant, for<br>
example, your employees can record at the same time multiple tickets without<br>
having to wait to do one transaction at a time. Along, to facilitate payment,<br>
the application allows multiple payment methods.<br>
<br>
The POS application is so simple and accessible to use that your shop or<br>
restaurant will never need any other tool to manage orders. Due to its smart<br>
and user-friendly interface you don't need any training to learn how to use it.<br>
Think of it as an out-of-the-box solution to boost your business' productivity.<br>
