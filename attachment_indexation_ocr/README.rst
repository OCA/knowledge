Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

#. install tesseract and the language(s) your documents use
#. if you want to support OCR on PDFs, install imagemagick
#. install the module itself

On an Debian or Ubuntu system you would typically run::

    $ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr imagemagick

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, go to:

#. Settings/Technical/Parameters/System parameters and review the parameters with names ocr.*

Usage
=====

By default, character recognition is done asynchronously by a cronjob at night.
This is because the recognition process takes a while and you don't want to make your users wait for the indexation to finish.
The interval to run the cronjob can be adjusted to your needs in the ``Scheduled Actions`` menu, under ` `Settings``.
In case you want to force the OCR to be done immediately, set configuration parameter ``ocr.synchronous`` to value ``True``.
