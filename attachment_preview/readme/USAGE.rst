The module adds a little print preview icon right of download links for
attachments or binary fields. When a preview is opened from the attachments
menu it's shown next to the form view. From this screen you can navigate
through the attachments using the arrow buttons. Using the pop-out button
next to the navigational buttons you can open the preview in a separate window.
