This addon allows to preview attachments supported by http://viewerjs.org.

Currently, that's most Libreoffice files and PDFs.

Installation
============

For filetype recognition, you'll get the best results by installing
``python-magic``:

sudo apt-get install python-magic

Usage
=====

The module adds a little print preview icon right of download links for
attachments or binary fields. When a preview is opened from the attachments
menu it's shown next to the form view. From this screen you can navigate
through the attachments using the arrow buttons. Using the pop-out button
next to the navigational buttons you can open the preview in a separate window.
