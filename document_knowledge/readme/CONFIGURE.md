To set up this module, you need to go to:

- Knowledge / Configuration / Settings

From this menu you'll have a central access to install the apps that
belong to Knowledge.

- Check *Attachments List and Document Indexation* if you want to
  install the module that allows users to attach documents to any model.
- Check *Manage attachments centrally* if you want all users to be able
  to access to the all attachments to which they have read permissions,
  from the menu *Knowledge / Documents*

If you want to grant Central Access to Documents only to some users:

1.  Go to *Settings/Activate the developer mode*. Only a user with
    *Administration / Settings* permissions can do that.
2.  Go to *Settings / Users & Companies / Users* and set the checkbox
    *Central access to Documents* to the selected users.
