Configuration
=============

To set up this module, you need to go to:

* Knowledge / Configuration / Settings

From this menu you'll have a central access to install the apps that belong
to Knowledge.

* Check *Attachments List and Document Indexation* if you want to install the
  module that allows users to attach documents to any model.
* Check *Manage attachments centrally* if you want all users to be able to
  access to the all attachments to which they have read permissions, from the
  menu *Knowledge / Documents*

If you want to grant Central Access to Documents only to some users:

#. Go to *Settings/Activate the developer mode*. Only a user with
   *Administration / Settings* permissions can do that.

#. Go to *Settings / Users & Companies / Users* and set the checkbox
   *Central access to Documents* to the selected users.

Usage
=====

This module adds a new top level menu *Knowledge*

Users with permission *Central access to Documents* can access in
*Knowledge/Documents* to all the documents attached to records of any model
for which they have read permission.
